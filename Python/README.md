# Python
In this directory I store all my Python personal projects.

# Multiple_line.py
This is a simple Python program that runs multiple lines
when you leave the cursor for the period of time stated in the program.


In order to use this program you should download the pyautogui library with this command in your VS Code terminal.
```pip install pyautogui```

Enjoy!
